export const aboutText = `
I am a frontend-focused developer and a Computer Engineering graduate from Bitlis Eren University.
During my university studies, I completed an internship where I worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

In my graduation project, I expanded my skill set by using Vue.js alongside these technologies to build a full-stack application.

Currently, I am focusing on improving myself in React.js and Tailwind CSS, actively developing projects to build clean, responsive, and user-friendly web interfaces using modern frontend practices.
